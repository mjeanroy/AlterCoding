                Hi Greg,
            </p>
            <p class="hyt-content">
                <a href="https://twitter.com/Ouarzy">Emilien Pecoul</a>
                asked the community if they would be interested in a training 
                on CQRS/Event Sourcing training with you,
                in <a href="https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Lyon">Lyon</a>,
                in september 2016.
            </p>
            <p class="hyt-content">
                Currently, <span class="hyt-answer-hightlight"><span ng-bind="hack.nbInterestedTrainees"></span> people are interested in this training</span> :
                <span class="hyt-proposal-people" ng-repeat="trainee in hack.interestedTrainees">
                   <a ng-href="{{trainee.twitterUrl}}">{{trainee.name}}</a>
                </span>
                <br/>
                They have not made any commitment to come, but we expect that around half of them would assist the training if you accept their request (perhaps others will join once planned).
            </p>
            <p class="hyt-content">
                <span class="hyt-answer-hightlight">Now, it is your turn to answer if you could propose them this training with a programme, dates, a price...</span>
                <br/>
                To help you better understand their request, they gave <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mxw6KnROn1mezi5gY2E9KIfu3uZr1fPBdeqkrCwrrL4/edit?usp=sharing">some constraints and expectations</a>. It is up to you to propose a training that match them at best.
                <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/3xrl0nWyFf6yf8wu1" class="btn btn-success hyt-answer-proposeButton">I answer</a>
            </p>
            <p class="hyt-content">
                NB: from logistic point of view, it will be organized by these interested people, with the help of local companies (for hosting, meals and official training).
                These companies will not take any margin on your price (as the training is organized by community for community), but free tickets could be offered as a compensation for their help.
